Functioning piano made with P5JS

This project consists on displaying piano keys so that if you click on any of then you would hear the note corresponding to that key in particular. (you can also use a, s, d, f, g, h, j, and k to play) I made this project to play around with p5.js' sound library and used the corresponding frequencies of each note to play it.
